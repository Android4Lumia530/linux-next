/// `EFAULT`. Concurrent access, *including data races to/from userspace
/// memory*, is permitted, because fundamentally another userspace
/// thread/process could always be modifying memory at the same time
/// (in the same way that userspace Rust's [`std::io`] permits data races
/// with the contents of files on disk). In the presence of a race, the
/// exact byte values read/written are unspecified but the operation is
/// well-defined. Kernelspace code should validate its copy of data
/// after completing a read, and not expect that multiple reads of the
/// same address will return the same value.
///
/// All APIs enforce the invariant that a given byte of memory from userspace
/// may only be read once. By preventing double-fetches we avoid TOCTOU
/// vulnerabilities. This is accomplished by taking `self` by value to prevent
/// obtaining multiple readers on a given [`UserSlicePtr`], and the readers
/// only permitting forward reads.
///
/// Constructing a [`UserSlicePtr`] only checks that the range is in valid
/// userspace memory, and does not depend on the current process (and
/// can safely be constructed inside a kernel thread with no current
/// userspace process). Reads and writes wrap the kernel APIs
/// `copy_from_user` and `copy_to_user`, and check the memory map of the
/// current process.
